# Notes

"Holds data structures used to transfer data between layers of your application (e.g., between controllers and services). DTOs often have a different structure than your database entities."

It seems that this is used for selecting what data is sent to the frontend instead of just interacting directly with the entity 

technically these are not needed but they are considered best practice for security and for decoupling
