# Tickey System Application
This repository is used to manage and store the code that is used with the enterpised application. It will be named and the description will be changed once a topic picked.

# Project Design Document

## Introduction

The application that we are going to make is a ticket managing system. This will allow for users to create tickets for current items that need to be worked on. Users will then be able to update the status of those tickets. Users will be able to mark tickets complete as well so that they no longer show on refresh.

Possible Addons:
- Ability to add comments to tickets
- Ability to see historical tickets

## Storyboard  
Screen mockups can be created using tools such as Invision, FluidUI, PowerPoint, Paint, etc.

## Functional Requirements  
Format: (Fill in the square brackets with your own words)

- **As a** [User]  
- **I want** [Feature]  
- **So that I can** [Do something]

As an Employee
I want to be able to create tickets
So that I can better manage work tasks as they are assigned

As a Managed
I want to be able to view current active tickets
So that I can see the current status on current projects

As an Employee
I want to be able to change the current status of a ticket
So that I can track the currents status of a ticket


### Examples:

- Given [Prerequisite]
- When [Series of Steps]
- Then [Expected Result]

**Notes:**
- You should have a few (2-4) requirements.
- The Given/When/Then syntax will form the basis of our unit tests.
- Consider different cases: good data, bad data, multiple sets of data, etc.

## Class Diagram  
- UML-based class diagram.
- **Class Diagram Description:** One or two lines for each class to describe the use of interfaces, classes, and resources.  
  - Don't worry about putting more than a few words per class.
  - This does not need to be thorough.

## JSON Schema  
Your project should have a REST endpoint that emits JSON, which another group can consume. The design document should contain a draft JSON schema for this endpoint.

- You can create a schema from a Java class at [QuickType.io](https://quicktype.io/).
- This Java class is typically a DTO.
- That's all you need at this point.

## Scrum Roles  
Emmanuella - UI Specialist
Aidan - Business Logic and Persistence Specialist
Product Owner/Devops  - Andrew

## GitHub Project Link  
[Insert GitHub project link here]

## Scrum/Kanban Board  
A **scrum or kanban board**, using GitHub Projects or similar, should contain:

- **Milestone #1** with associated tasks.
- **Projects for Milestone #1.**
- **Tasked Stories for Milestone #1**, including:
  - Sprint tasks that elaborate on the stories, with technical details.
  - These should be technical tasks required to implement one of the features.
  - Only task out stories for **Sprint #1**.  
  - Sprints #2 and #3 can be defined as we get closer.

### Sprint Planning
- The **Product Owner/Scrum Master/DevOps** person should select stories to play for each sprint from the **Product Backlog**.
- As long as tasks exist in **GitHub Projects**, associated with milestones, there is no need to repeat them in the design document.
- Milestones for **Milestone #2 and #3** should be defined but do not need projects or tasks yet.
