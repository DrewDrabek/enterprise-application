# Project Design Document

## Introduction

## Storyboard  
Screen mockups can be created using tools such as Invision, FluidUI, PowerPoint, Paint, etc.

## Functional Requirements  
Format: (Fill in the square brackets with your own words)

- **As a** [User]  
- **I want** [Feature]  
- **So that I can** [Do something]  

### Examples:

- Given [Prerequisite]
- When [Series of Steps]
- Then [Expected Result]

**Notes:**
- You should have a few (2-4) requirements.
- The Given/When/Then syntax will form the basis of our unit tests.
- Consider different cases: good data, bad data, multiple sets of data, etc.

## Class Diagram  
- UML-based class diagram.
- **Class Diagram Description:** One or two lines for each class to describe the use of interfaces, classes, and resources.  
  - Don't worry about putting more than a few words per class.
  - This does not need to be thorough.

## JSON Schema  
Your project should have a REST endpoint that emits JSON, which another group can consume. The design document should contain a draft JSON schema for this endpoint.

- You can create a schema from a Java class at [QuickType.io](https://quicktype.io/).
- This Java class is typically a DTO.
- That's all you need at this point.

## Scrum Roles  
- List the scrum roles and who will fill them.

## GitHub Project Link  
[Insert GitHub project link here]

## Scrum/Kanban Board  
A **scrum or kanban board**, using GitHub Projects or similar, should contain:

- **Milestone #1** with associated tasks.
- **Projects for Milestone #1.**
- **Tasked Stories for Milestone #1**, including:
  - Sprint tasks that elaborate on the stories, with technical details.
  - These should be technical tasks required to implement one of the features.
  - Only task out stories for **Sprint #1**.  
  - Sprints #2 and #3 can be defined as we get closer.

### Sprint Planning
- The **Product Owner/Scrum Master/DevOps** person should select stories to play for each sprint from the **Product Backlog**.
- As long as tasks exist in **GitHub Projects**, associated with milestones, there is no need to repeat them in the design document.
- Milestones for **Milestone #2 and #3** should be defined but do not need projects or tasks yet.

## Stand-up Meeting Link  
[Insert link to Teams or other meeting tool]  

- If you choose a different tool/time, indicate it in the document.
- If the repo is public and you prefer not to put the Teams link there, email it to the group instead.
- Still, list the **date and time** of the weekly meeting(s).
